# Practice TDD Repository

This repository is dedicated to the practice of test-driven development (TDD) with the FizzBuzz game as its subject.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to apply the TDD methodology on different languages with the FizzBuzz game.

- Learning to use a new language with a familiar game
- Learning to use the associated testing frameworks for that language
- practice TDD

## TDD Methodology

1. Write a test for a missing functionality.
2. Run the test (which should fail as the functionality isn't implemented).
3. Implement the minimum code for the test to pass.
4. Refactor if necessary.
5. Repeat the process for each new functionality.
